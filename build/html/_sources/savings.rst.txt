How much do people save?
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

People earn income, for the large part from work, over their entire life. From that income, they spend on goods which they consume, some of which they leave for their heirs. There is no one-to-one relationship between when we earn income and when we spend it. Luckily, we can save some income for later and we can borrow when income is low. There is a lot of saving, and then dissaving, whether it is voluntary or not. For example, paying mandatory pension contributions reduces potential expenditures today against a promise to receive income in the future that allows to spend on goods when old. Paying taxes has also a savvings component since lots of government spending is devoted to the young (who earn no income) and the old, who for example consume a lot of health care. In this set of lectures, we will be mostly concerned with voluntary private savings. Savings are a stock, with the accumulation of contributions, returns and withdrawals being the flows. Let the stock of saving all savings, say at market value, be :math:`w_t`. If we denote by :math:`s_t` contributions when positive and negative when withdrawals, then the stock evolves according to 

.. math::
        w_{t+1} = (1+r_t) w_{t} + s_{t}

Turns out governments have limited information on stocks but also on flows. Admin data in most countries, with the exception of some scandinavian countries, is not available on savings stock and flows such that we follow the equation above. Hence, we must resort to surveys to get information savings flows and stocks. 

Canada has a cross-sectional data infrastructure that allows to get a picture, one in a while of how much people save (and have saved). Statistics Canada runs two surveys, each with their specific purpose, that allow us to paint some portrait of private savings, the Survey of Household Spending `Survey of Household Spending <https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=3508>`_ and the `Survey of Financial Security (SFS) <https://www23.statcan.gc.ca/imdb/p2SV.pl?Function=getSurvey&SDDS=2620>`_ . The Survey of Household Spending gives us information on income, spending and some measures of direct active savings. This is a good survey for flows. For stocks, the Survey of Financial Survey allows us to construct the balance sheet of Canadians. The SHS is run annually while the SFS is run every five years or so (1999, 2005, 2012, 2016). For researchers at Canadian university, public micro-use files (PUMFS) can be downloaded from `ODESI <http://odesi2.scholarsportal.info.proxy2.hec.ca/webview/>`_. 

Take flows first. Measuring saving contributions can be done in a number of ways, each imperfect. Sometimes, respondents are asked directly whether they have contributed to a savings account, :math:`s_t`. Sometimes, they are asked instead information on spending, :math:`c_t` and income :math:`y_t` and an implied savings variable can be created, :math:`s_t = y_t - c_t`. This is a savings measure that does not account for unrealized capital gains since these are not materialized in income. However,  since :math:`y_t` often includes interest and dividend income, it does include some form of the return component of savings in :math:`r_t w_t`.  Spending surveys get good measures of spending by asking for detailed questions on many categories of goods. There is also the question of how to include pension contributions and taxes in this definition. Finally, some construct savings from asking for changes in wealth at two points :math:`s_t = w_{t} - w_{t-1}`. Again, this is not a direct measure of :math:`s_t` as defined in the equation above since it will include unrealized capital gains. 

The next figure from SHS shows average consumption and spending at the household level by age in 2009. The information is aggregated by age groups. One important point to make is that a period age-profile does not necessarily represent how a cohort behaves over the life-cycle. In other words, the 65 year olds are from a different generation than the 25 year olds in the plot. If there are large differences in income or other characteristics, the period profile is a poor guide to what happens to a cohort over the life-cycle. One useful tool to deal with this when repeated cross-sectional data is available is the synthetic cohort method. `Attanasio (1998) <https://www.jstor.org/stable/146334?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents>`_ is a good example applied to savings.

We can compare the two definitions of savings rates across income quintiles. The next figure shows the average savings rate using the consumption definition and using wealth changes. While the pattern is similar and slopes are similar, there are some differences between the two measures. Interestingly, those with higher income save more as a fraction of income than those with lower income.

Private savings can take many form. We tend to refer to savings as either being registered or unregistered, depending on whether they are subject to specific tax treatment or not.  Unregistered savings essentially takes the form of cash and deposit accounts, bonds and stocks that are held outside of tax-preferred saving vehicles. Registered forms of  savings include for the most part Tax-free Savings Accounts (TFSA) and Registered Retirement Savings Plan (RRSP). Since unregistered savings are made out of money that has been taxed, we say that saving contributions are taxed. Unregistered savings are also taxed trough the taxation of returns (dividends, etc). But they are not taxed on the stock or amount owned (there is no wealth tax in Canada), nor are they taxed when we take money out of our accounts. We say that they have a TTE tax treatment, for contribution (T), returns (T) and widthrawals (E).  TFSAs are TEE while RRSP are EET. There is one less T, the middle T compared to unregistered funds. In the next figure we plot the fraction of respondents in SHS who contribute and withdraw funds from RRSPs. We see that RRSP contributions are hump-shaped while withdrawals increase around the time of retirement. But there are withdrawals before retirement as well.

Contribution rates and amounts (conditional on contributing) are quite skewed in terms of income as the next figure shows.

Registered savings are very popular. For example Statistics Canada reports for 2018, a total of  43.5 billion dollars in `RRSP contributions <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/t1/tbl1/en/tv.action?pid=1110004401>`_ while the number of 66 billion for `TFSA <https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/programs/about-canada-revenue-agency-cra/income-statistics-gst-hst-statistics/tax-free-savings-account-statistics/tax-free-savings-account-statistics-2018-tax-year.html>`_ in the same year. 

Adding unregistered to registered savings, we often denote total savings as liquid wealth or financial wealth. Implicitely, this allows to make the distinction with another form of wealth, the stock of real assets, such as cars and real estate. The Survey of Financial Security allows us to draw a good portrait of financial wealth. In the next figure, we plot the distribution of financial wealth by age. One can see that other than the obvious age profile, there is a lot of variability. Some people have lots of wealth while others have little. 

Zooming in to the near retirees (age 55-65), and representing by income quintiles the distribution of financial wealth, we see that those who have higher income have generally accumulated more much financial wealth. Lots accumulate very little wealth. Because wealth is so skewed, we often use the median as a statistic. Other times, we clip (or winsorize) the data to throw out outliers. Another way of avoiding outliers when presenting ratios is to use ratio of means rather than mean of ratios.  

In terms of wealth composition, we have the following composition by quintiles. 

Finally, we can express medians financial wealth as a multiple of income for the near retirees. Someone in the middle quintile has roughly 3 times is income in terms of private liquid savings. This one at the bottom has less than his income in savings. The one in the top quintiles has 6 times his income. Is that a lot? or too little? Are people saving enough?

Theory
++++++

Why do people save? How much should people save? It is useful to first look at a benchmark, the life-cycle model in order to answer these questions. 

Existing level of mandatory savings. Unknown preferences 

Some studies have tried to determine whether people save enough for retirement. They reach very different conclusions. 

`Liu, Ostrovsky and Zhou  (2013) <https://www150.statcan.gc.ca/n1/en/pub/11-622-m/11-622-m2013029-eng.pdf?st=7KHtrmbl>`_

A last group of studies attempted to see how spending changed at the time of retirement. Taking the standard life-cycle model literally, these studies anchor their test on the prediction that the Euler equation would predict a smooth path for consumption around the time of retirement. The most famous study was realized by X. Latter authors mention a number of issues with this test since it considers a very restrictive version of the life-cycle model. 

If we accept that some are saving too little, one may ask why that is. For example, one big policy problems in the late 1990s was the relative disappearance of mandatory savings trough employer pensions in the U.S., so called defined benefit pensions. Individual accounts were setup where workers could enroll and decide to save a fraction of their salary, with some of that matched by their employer. Turns out enrollment rates were very low, despite very large returns, even among groups where saving more was probably optimal. 

One leading explanation is that we tend to procastinate when something entails immediate costs against delayed rewards. This leads us to be time-inconsistent, we postone an action to the future and when the future comes, we postpone it again. The standard model does not allow for that. If one is extremely impatient, then it is optimal not to save period. This form of procastination was operationalized by Laison (1997) by twitsing the discount function we use in the exponential discounting model. Based on evidence from psychology, it appears that we discount the short time at a much higher rate than the long-term.
