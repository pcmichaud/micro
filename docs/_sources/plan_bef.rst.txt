Syllabus
--------

This course has two objectives. The first is to introduce students to so-called behavioral models which deviate from the classical models of behavior under risk and over time which are relevant for household financial topics. The second is to introduce students to combining data and theory to understand behavior and apply these theories to problems, or anomalies encountered in household finance.

Google has set up a very nice platform called Google collab to work with Python using Notebooks. It only requires that you have a google drive account. Please setup one and check it out. 

See this notebook to familiarize yourself with the Python environment. For each lecture, you will see an icon like this which you can click on to open up the notebook in Google colab.  |ImageLink|_
