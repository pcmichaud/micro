<p>At the household level, saving is often perceived as a positive thing while contracting debt is negatively perceived. But being able to borrow to finance consumption or cash flows to operate a small business plays a vital role in our economy and yields economic benefits compared to a situation where people can’t borrow. Think of how you could purchase a home without mortgage debt being available. How would you finance the purchase of expensive durables, etc? Just like it is possible to save too much or too little it is also possible to borrow too much or too little. This has welfare consequences.</p>
<p>Households borrow more than non-financial companies do (13 trillion compared to 10 trillion) according to Zinman (2015). More people have credit cards than participate in the stock market. Research lags behind considerably relative to the asset side of the balance sheet. We should care because this likely affects poor people more, perhaps more prompt to behavioral biases.</p>
<p>In recent years, household debt has been on the rise. In 2012, Canada only lagged the U.K. in terms of household debt to GDP as the following chart shows.</p>

<h3>Trends<a class="headerlink" href="#trends" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>The burden of household debt is often measured as the ratio of debt to income. For example, National accounts of Canada allow to compute an aggregate measure of debt to income, using total debt and total disposable income. From  1990 to 2020, we can see the ratio of debt to income has doubled,  increasing  from 90% to more than 180%. Is this cause for concern?</p>

<p>One group that received considerable attention is the near elderly who are on the verge of retirement or have already retired. Retired households have fewer margins of adjustment when things go south (they can’t work more so easily). In a recent paper, we show that trends in the debt-to-income ratio have been stronger in the tails, suggesting that this increase is not widespread but due to a relatively large group who is massively taking on debt compared to the past.</p>

<p>Keeping the focus on this group, we see that while mortgage debt has increased, its share of total debt has not increased substantially over time. On the other hand, lines of credit and term loans have increased in terms of importance.</p>

<p>Debt cannot be looked at in isolation. Assets have also increased in value. If higher debt holdings simply reflect the fact that more assets are accumulated, the balance sheet of households is not necessarily in a worse position. While debt to income measures to some extent the repayment capacity of households, if they hang on to their assets, debt to asset is a good measure of solvency risk of households. We see that debt to assets has increased among the near elderly but not as drastically as debt to income.</p>

<h3>Composition<a class="headerlink" href="#composition" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>The following figure from a Financial Consumer Agency Study in 2019 (The Canadian Financial Capability Survey or CFCS) shows that 40% of Canadians have a mortgage. Vehicle loans and credit cards are owned by respectively 28% and 29% of the population. Lines of credit by 20% while home equity backed lines of credit (HELOC) by 13% of the population. 11% have student loans while 5% have secondary mortgages and other personal loans.</p>

<p>By far, the category with the largest debt is mortgage debt, with an average value of 262,000$ for those with a mortgage. The average amount is much lower for other types of debt, between 28000$ and 40000$.</p>

<h3>Mortgage Debt<a class="headerlink" href="#mortgage-debt" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>Mortgages are backed by the value of the asset, the house. We see that the distribution of outstanding mortgages is centered in values between 100 000$ and 200 000$. Less than 12% of households have a mortgage in excess of 400 000$.</p>

<p>Because Canada is one of the OECD countries where the value of houses has increased the most, this has certainly played a role in explaining how debt has increased over time in Canada. The following figure shows house price indices for the three major Canadian cities: Toronto, Vancouver and Montréal. Growth has been almost exponential in Toronto and Vancouver in the last 10 years while it has been more modest in Montréal. In recent years, and in particular with the pandemic, house prices have risen sharply in all of these cities, in particular in the Montréal region. This has implications for thinking about mortgage debt.</p>

<p>Interest rates on mortgages have declined sharply over the last 20 years, following the general downward trend in interest rates. Hence, borrowing costs have declined at the same time as house prices have increased. As shown in the following table from Bédard and Michaud (2011), mortgage payments have actually stagnated, if not declined, over the period while mortgage balances have increased considerably. This means that the increase in house prices leads to much larger mortgages but payments which are kept constant relative to income. This is an important observation which is hidden when we look only at debt to income for repayment capacity. Interest rates are key. If interest rates go back up, some households could end up with a worse financial outlook.</p>

<p>It is important to understand how mortgages work. There are two types of mortgages in Canada, fixed and variable rate mortgages. The term of a mortgage is typically something like 25 years. But unlike mortgages in countries such as the U.S., the interest rate on the mortgage is renegotiated (renewed) more frequently, very often with a frequency of 5 years. Rates are either variable or fixed and there is a wide variety of arrangements. When rates change at renewal, payments or the term of the mortgage can change to adjust. More than three quarters of mortgages in Canada are fixed mortgages while one fourth are variable rates. It is possible to prepay a mortgage by making additional payments, up to some limit. It is also possible to borrow against home equity either by increasing the mortgage contract or by using a home-equity line of credit (HELOC).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lines-of-credit">
<h3>Lines of Credit<a class="headerlink" href="#lines-of-credit" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>Lines of credit are popular in Canada, more so than in the U.S. In particular, home-equity lines of credit are becoming quite popular for households who are <em>house rich</em> but <em>cash-poor</em>. While rates on lines of credit are slightly higher than the prime mortgage rate, they remain a relatively cheap form of flexible borrowing for unexpected expenses or for home-related projects such as renovations. Interestingly, more than 38% of people with lines of credit do not have outstanding balance. Hence, they have this credit available in case they need it. If we add those to individuals with balances less than 50 000$, we get that 77% of individuals have balances of less than 50 000$.</p>

<div class="section" id="credit-cards">
<h3>Credit Cards<a class="headerlink" href="#credit-cards" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>The use of credit cards as revolving credit has been one of the key financial innovations for households in the last 30 years. Their use is now widespread. Since it represents unsecured lending, credit card interest rates are much higher than rates on other types of loans (typically closer to 15%). But their usefulness in transactions, in particular online, means that they are quite useful for short-term borrowing or as a payment method. As one can see from the FCAC study, few actually use it because they are short of money (less than 12%). Interestingly, 17% use it for online purchases, 30% to collect reward points and finally 38% for accounting purposes and convenience.</p>

<p>In 2016, most near retirees had a credit card (89%) with still 17.9% having more than 5 cards in the household. Credit card lending has seen some tightening up in recent years and the evidence below shows that a growing proportion has been rejected for a credit card. Similar to what is found in the FCAC study, more than three quarters of individuals near retirement pay their card in full each month. This is important has interest kicks in on credit card for credit lasting more than one month (within the month, it does not carry interest). In terms of making payments, close to 5% of individuals near retirement typically pay the minimum or less. Close to a quarter pays more than the minimum but typically not the full balance. Finally, less than 6% of near retirees skip or delay non-mortgage payments and this percentage varies somewhat across provinces but remains relatively low.</p>

<p>In terms of bill payments, which includes credit card payments, close to two thirds of Canadians report that they do not struggle in any area. Quite worrisome, 27% borrow for daily expenses because they report being short on money.</p>

<p>Budgeting may be related to credit card use. We see that among that the fraction who use credit cards because they are short of money runs at 21% among those who do not budget (they find it boring or have no time for it)  while the percentage is 3% among those who do budget.</p>

<h3>Student Loans<a class="headerlink" href="#student-loans" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>As the cost of education is increasing, in particular in provinces outside of Quebec, where tuition remains lower, student loans become much more prevalent. According to the FCAC study, half of individuals 16-24 have student loans. This percentage remains high at 36% among those 25 to 29 and 21% among those 30 to 34. By the time individuals reach 35 years old, only a small fraction has loans.</p>

<h3>Payday Loans<a class="headerlink" href="#payday-loans" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>Between 2 and 4% of Canadians use Payday loans. These loans are typically for a few days, often synched with when people receive their paychecks. The interest rate charged on those loans can easily attain 50-100% on an annual basis. FCAC did a study in 2017 on payday loan users.</p>
<p>In terms of age, those 35-44 represent the largest share of users. Payday loan use, as one might expect is also associated with having low income although it is surprising that even those with relatively high incomes use those loans.</p>

<p>A 300$ payday loan taken for 14 days cost 63$ compared to 5.8$ for a line of credit, 7.2$ for an overdraft protection on a bank account or a cash advance on a credit card (7.4$). Hence, this is nearly 8-9 times more expensive.</p>

<h3>Insolvency<a class="headerlink" href="#insolvency" title="Lien permanent vers ce titre">¶</a></h3>
<p>When debt becomes out of control, one needs to borrow just to make payments on existing debt. The fraction of Canadians who are insolvent is between 4 and 5%, with peaks in recessions. It is risen slightly in recent years. When individuals become insolvent, they enter a process which may ultimately lead to bankruptcy. While bankruptcies increase in recessions, they have declined recently while the approach has been to work with creditors to find a plan that avoids bankruptcy through a proposal. These have been on the rise in recent years.</p>
