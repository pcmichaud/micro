.. _Intro:

Anomalies
---------

Household finance is concerned with financial choices made by households, from savings, to holding debt, to investing, to retiring and deciding which insurance products to purchase. Household finance is potentially filled with behavior which do not seem to agree with our intuition. These are often called anomalies. But are they? Here are some examples:

Annuities
+++++++++

In their simplest form, annuities allow an agent to receive a certain stream of payments until death against an immediate cash payment. An annuity has the advantage of providing an insurance against longevity risk, the risk of outliving one's savings. 

Few individuals nearing retirement hold little annuities outside public pensions. 

Is this cause for concern?

Savings
+++++++

There is a significant fraction of the population that saves little on their own for retirement. Others do not have sufficient liquid saving to cover expenses for two months. 

Is this cause for concern?

Investment
++++++++++

When it comes to portfolio choice, many  put all their eggs in the same basket, invest more in domestic stocks, and trade often. Because they are chasing returns, they often end up buying high and selling low. Some do not understand fees. Others invest in taxable accounts without opening an RRSP or TFSA. 

Is this cause for concern?

Household Debt 
++++++++++++++

We observe lots of household debt, even into retirement. And it is increasing in every segment of the population. 

Is this cause for concern?

Why BEF?
++++++++

Each of these situations started with observing what people do. We need data for that. Luckily we have some and may sources exist. This is the first step to understanding a household finance problem. We first need to understand the facts. Understand the heterogeneity across people, trends over time. Interpreting the facts to answer a question requires models, whether it is explicit or implicit. 

There are two ways of thinking about behavioral economics. One is positive in nature. We want to have a model of how people make decisions. We might build a model from scratch. But often, we will start from the workhorse neoclassical model, say expected utility if this is behavior that involves risk, or discounted utility if it involves time. That model may do well already in explaining the facts. After all, neoclassical economists were behavioral economists with behavioral theories for explaining patterns of behavior. Friedman, von Neuman and Morgenstern, Fisher,  Modigliani, Yaari and others were all preoccupied with having a good model of what agents do in order to predict how they would respond to incentives for example.  

Behavioral economics was born as a separate field from mainstream neo-classical microeconomics because standard models often fail to fit observed behavior. They may need enrichment to capture some of the behaviors we observe. It is a mixture of theory, but also lots of data and experimentation that allow behavioral economists to understand what we need to take into account to enrich our workhorse model. The distinction between what is behavioral and what is mainstream is rapidly fading away...

But there is another motivation, normative, for doing behavioral economics. We asked the question earlier: are these patterns cause for concern? Are they anomalies? 

How should an economist answer a question like that?  This is a hard question. A natural starting point is to think of a benchmark: what should people do optimally and does their action makes them worse off relative to that benchmark? One benchmark dear to economists is the neoclassical model, which means everything and nothing, but perhaps in its most simplistic form for our purposes an expected discounted utility model with unbiased expectations. If that model maps well into what people are doing, it is hard to think of why the observed behavior is a cause for concern. People are acting close to optimally according to our benchmark. Despite having its own limits, this is the approach taken by many behavioral economists. 

Turns out, people do not act close to optimally by that metric. There is a gap, no matter how rich our neoclassical model is, between what people do and what we think they should be doing. Behavioral economics aims to understand that gap, by enriching the classical model with alternative takes on how decisions are made, biases or misperceptions, mistakes, limited knowledge, time inconsistency. 

When we are able to develop a satisfactory model of how decisions are made. We can then compare it to the benchmark. Understand where do deviations come from and then, find ways to help individuals make choices closer to the benchmark. This approach can take the form of education, decision aids, financial advice or even what is called choice architecture, a topic we will encounter later in the course. 

Are these interventions efficient? How much do they cost? Are they leading to undesirable outcomes? Equiped with models, one is better able to answer these questions. 

Is Theory Useful?
+++++++++++++++++

Modelling behavior that deviates from standard models often takes us to more complicated models. Models are useful because they make our statements sharper, allow us to make falsiable predictions. But we do not want to do theory for the sake of doing theory. When possible, we will try and keep the math simple. For example, there is no need to consider a multi-period model of intertemporal choice if we can convey basic ideas in a two-period model. Hence, the requirements for this course is that you have a basic understanding of calculus and of intermediate microeconomics (see my class notes for 20-851 if that is far in our mind). But we will also want to develop abilities to room free from simple models into more realistic ones by getting a sense of how to use numerical methods (programming) to solve models. This is a skill that will seem difficult at first. But will prove useful by the end of the course, in particular to think about choice under uncertainty. 

Empirical Methods
+++++++++++++++++

Data is needed to observe the facts. One needs to be able to analyze data, describe it. We will spend quite a bit of time doing that. Little econometrics or statistics, but learning how to manipulate micro data is an essential skill. Dealing with measurement error and other problems that plague data are important and very often not taught in standard econometric courses. 

We will also look into methods to elicit preferences, expectations and learn from choices in experimental settings. The idea is that by the time you finish this course, you are able to review critically a study using elicitation or experimental methods and if you go on to do research on your own, are able to conduct an experiment. 

Coming back to Anomalies
++++++++++++++++++++++++

The course is structured around 5 areas of choice in household finance we started with above. We will learn in each case to construct basic facts, develop an understanding of what the benchmark model predicts, and review how choices can be improved with an intervention toolkit. We will roughly spend three courses on each topic, covering the facts, the theory and interventions. Although many topics of interest will not be covered, this will allow us to dig into some of these essential topics, each with their own set of behavioral theories and methods.
