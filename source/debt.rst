Facts
+++++

Savings is often perceived as positive while debt is negative. But being able to borrow to finance consumption or cash flows to operate a small business plays a vital role in our economy and yields economic benefits compared to a situation where people can’t borrow. Think of how you could purchase a home without mortgage debt being available. How would you finance the purchase of a car, etc? Just like it is possible to save too much or too little ir is also possible to borrow to much or two little. 

Households borrow more than non-financial companies do (13 trillion compared to 10 trillion). More people have credit cards than participate in the stock market. Research lags behind considerably relative to asset side of balance sheet. We should care because affects poor more, perhaps more prompt to behavioral biases.  

In recent years, household debt has been on the rise. In 2012, Canada only lagged the U.K. in terms of household debt to GDP as the following chart shows.

Various measures of debt can be computed depending on what one is trying to measure. A debt to income measure, or debt service to income measure focuses on ability to re-pay. Another measure is to look at debt relative to assets, which is perhaps more relevant to talk about solvency risk.
