\begin{enumerate}
    \item A consumer has preferences given by $u(X) = \log X$. She currently has a lottery ticket she is willing to sell. There is a 75\% chance she wins 100 dollars and a 25\% chance she looses 100 dollars. Her current wealth is 500 dollars. What is the minimum price she is willing to sell the ticket for? \textit{Answer: She is willing to accept at least 42.13 dollars}. 
    \item A entrepreneur meets with the Dragons and one of them makes an offer for two-thirds of profits against an investment of 5,000\$ in his business. He himself would need to put in 5,000\% (half of his savings) and would get only one third of profits. He has a 25\% chance of making 100,000\$ and a 75\% chance of loosing his investment. He has preferences represented by $u(X) = \sqrt{X}$. Should he accept the proposal? If he refuses, what is the offer he could counter-offer with that would make him indifferent between starting the business or dropping his plan? \textit{Answer: He refuses the current offer and would prefer to not start the business. He is willing to counter offer anything less than 64.7\% of profits in exchange for a 5,000\$ investment.} 
    \item Show that those picking $L_1$ over $L_2$ and picking $L_4$ over $L_3$ in the Allais Paradox have preferences that are inconsistent with expected utility theory. \textit{Answer: Write down EU with u() unspecified. You get $L_1 \succ L_2$ if $u(50)>\frac{1}{11}u(0) + \frac{10}{11}u(250)$ but the opposite if $L_4 \succ L_3$. A contradiction.}
    \item Show that no matter the subjective fraction of while balls (among those white or black) in the Ellsberg Paradox, those picking $L_1$ over $L_2$ and $L_4$ over $L_3$ do not behave according to expected utility theory. \textit{Answer: Write down EU with p, the probability of white (as a fraction of black or white) unspecified. Then $L_1 \succ L_2$ iff $p<0.5$ but the opposite, $p>0.5$ if $L_4 \succ L_3$. A contradiction.}
